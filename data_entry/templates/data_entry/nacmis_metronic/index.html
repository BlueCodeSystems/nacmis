            <p>Welcome to the National HIV/ADIS/STI/TB Council Management Information System (NACMIS)</p>

            <p>NACMIS provides a holistic picture for the HIV/AIDS response in Zambia for not only decision-makers across all 
            levels but also the public. This is a platform that officially triangulates the National HIV/AIDS programmatic 
            data with social-determinant, behavior change and clinical data sets in line with the National HIV/AIDS 
            Strategic Framework 2017-2021 in order to develop a culture of HIV/AIDS prevention data for decision-making at 
            all levels of government and partner interventions.</p>
            
            <p>Thank you for partnering in the response to HIV/AIDS.</p>
